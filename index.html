		<h2 id="summary">About Me</h2>
		<div class="row">
      <div class="span12">
				<p>I am a freelance web developer with over 7 years experience of building Javascript web-applications for large corporate and enterprise clients.</p>
				<p>Having started out life coding on the LAMP stack, I have, since early 2008, specialised in Javascript development, becoming fluent in a number of frameworks and libraries on both the client and the server as well as developing clients' bespoke DOM and UI libraries written in native Javascript.</p>
				<p>In recent years I have been focussed on building robust, resilient and scalable software applications based on NodeJS. This has involved making a number of contributions back into the projects used, and also developing and releasing my own open-source tools through npm.</p>
				<p>Over the course of my career, I have worked for a number of large, high-profile end-clients, including Barclays, British Gas, BSkyB, GOV.UK, The Home Office, HSBC, JWT, Lloyds TSB, Marks &amp; Spencer, O2, RBS Group, Santander, Unilever and Virgin Atlantic.</p>
